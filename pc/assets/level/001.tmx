	Dear crew after a long journey we have final reached SOMEPLANET.
	This has taken us one step closer to create a new home for humankind.
	Because the planet might be dangerous, we can not send humans to it yet.
	So it is up to our scientist and programmers, 
	with theire robots to explore the planet and build a first base. \

	The robots have landed unharmed on the planet.
	Since a long time, the robots are back in action.
	We should ensure that you are still aware, of their handling.
	You controll the robots with the same color as the light below your screen.
	Due to electric interferences not every instruction is aviable in every level.
	Also the data rate is limited. So you can only use each instruction a certain times.
	The total count of instructions is also limited to 12.
	Remender that the robot drives automatically.
	At this level only three instructions are avaiable.
	First the rotate right and left instructions (â†±,â†°).
	Last the wait instruction (âŒ›).
	This instruction means that no change to the state of your robot will perform.
	So if it is currently dirving it will continue driving.
	Move the cursor with ðŸ ´ and ðŸ ¶ key and select an instruction with A.
	B will remove the last instruction from your code.
	Change with ðŸ µ and ðŸ · the count of cycle you robot will wait.
	Your goal at this training it to reach the flag with the color of your robot.
	So take your programming termial and create instructions for your robot.\
