Alternative you can easily build Mission to Teegarden b  by yourself:

 - on Linux install the following development dependencies. At some distros (like Alpine and Debian) seperate development packages exist, regular suffixed with `-dev`. If this the case make sure that you have also installed the `*-dev` version.
	 - [`alsa-lib`][__link3]
	 - [`libudev`][__link4]
	
	
 - [install rust][__link5] and unpack the source code.
 - run `cargo install --path pc --locked` inside the unpacked folder, to build and install the mission2teegarden-b. See the [rust book][__link6] for more information about cargo install.
 - make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is listed at the `PATH` enviroment variable, otherwise the `mission2teegarden-b` executeable can not be found.

 - optional: install nightly toolchain for better error messages at the pybadge. `rustup toolchain install nightly --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf` and unpack the source code (if not already done).
 - press the reset button of the pybadge twice to enter bootloader
 - compile and flash program by running `cargo +nightly run --release -locked` inside the downloaded `pybadge` folder. `+nightly` is optional and have to be left out if the ‚Äúinstall nightly toolchain‚Äù step was skip. Please use `+nightly` for bug reports.
