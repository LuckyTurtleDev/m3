[![Packaging status][__link0]][__link1]

Prebuild binarys can also been downloaded from the [Github release][__link2].


#### Building from source:

Alternative you can easily build Mission to Teegarden b  by yourself:

 - on Linux install the following development dependencies:
	 - [`alsa-lib`][__link3]
	 - [`libudev`][__link4] At some distros (lika Alpine and Debian) seperate development packages exist, regular suffixed with `-dev`. It this the case make sure that you have also installed the `*-dev` packages.
	
	
 - [install rust][__link5]
 - [Download][__link6] and unpack the source code.
 - run `cargo install --path pc --locked` inside the unpacked folder, to build and install the mission2teegarden-b. See the [rust book][__link7] for more information about cargo install.
 - make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is listed at the `PATH` enviroment variable, otherwise the `mission2teegarden-b` executeable can not be found.


## Flash Pybadge:

 - Install an UF2 flasher. I recommand using [hf2-cli][__link8].
 - Download and unpack Pybadge binary from [Github release][__link9].
 - Press the reset button of the pybdage twice, to enter the bootloader.
 - After this execute `hf2 elf mission2teegarden-b-pybadge` (or the corresponding command of your flahing tool) to flash the binary to the pybadge.
 - Press the reset button again.


#### Building from source:

Alternative you can build m3 by yourself:

 - [install rustup][__link10]
 - run `cargo install hf2-cli --locked` to build and install the [hf2-cli][__link11] flasher. See the [rust book][__link12] for more information about cargo install.
 - make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is listed at the `PATH` enviroment variable otherwise the executeable can not be found..
 - install the rust `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target (the architecture of the pybadge) by executing `rustup target install thumbv7em-none-eabihf`.
 - optional: install nightly toolchain for better error messages at the pybadge. `rustup toolchain install nightly --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
 - [Download][__link13] and unpack the source code (if not already done).
 - press the reset button of the pybadge twice to enter bootloader
 - compile and flash program by running `cargo +nightly run --release -locked` inside the downloaded `pybadge` folder. `+nightly` is optional and have to be left out if the ‚Äúinstall nightly toolchain‚Äù step was skip. Please use `+nightly` for bug reports.
